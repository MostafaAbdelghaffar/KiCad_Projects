# KiCad_Projects
Beginner friendly projects, to practice KiCad and design PCBs using KiCad

### Introduction: 
This Repo is made for beginner friendly KiCad design for training purposes. This acts as a portfolio for the trainings and projets I have worked for designing PCBs.

The first one "StopLight" is meant to be familiar with the KiCad tool as the training that I had was on Altium. It is a simple pcb design with 3 LEDs and 3 Resistors and a connector.

As a PCB designer you need to know the following:
1. Know the capabilities of your PCB manufacturer
2. Have a solid understanding of the PCB design process
3. Have a solid understanding of the PCB Design tools
4. Have the patience to build up your skills


### Description: 
#### The following are the GENERAL steps for designing PCB in order

1. Define design rules and requirement
2. Create a schematic: Detailed schematic of the board's electrical design
3. Place components (taking into account signal integrity, thermal management and manufacturability)
4. Route traces: use color coded route tracing to create cirtual pathways between components and determine ther most efficient design layout.
5. Add labels and identifiers: including markers and reference designator or other identifying information to the layout.
6. Insert drill holes


#### The following are the KiCad design workflow in order:
