# KiCad_Projects
Beginner friendly projects, to practice KiCad and design PCBs using KiCad

#### The following are the GENERAL steps for designing PCB in order

1. Define design rules and requirement
2. Create a schematic: Detailed schematic of the board's electrical design
3. Place components (taking into account signal integrity, thermal management and manufacturability)
4. Route traces: use color coded route tracing to create cirtual pathways between components and determine ther most efficient design layout.
5. Add labels and identifiers: including markers and reference designator or other identifying information to the layout.
6. Insert drill holes


#### The following are the KiCad design workflow in order:
